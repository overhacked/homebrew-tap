# Homebrew Formulae

This is the [Homebrew][] tap for my ([@Overhacked](https://github.com/overhacked)) projects, currently just [`ssh-agent-mux`](https://github.com/overhacked/ssh-agent-mux).

These formulae are available for both Mac and Linux homebrew and for `amd64/x86_64` and `arm64/aarch64` architectures.

## Initial setup

If you don't have Homebrew, install it from their [homepage][homebrew].

Then, add this tap:

```
brew tap overhacked/tap
```

## Installing

To install SSH Agent Mux:

```
brew install ssh-agent-mux
```

## Updating

Simply run:

```
brew update
brew upgrade ssh-agent-mux
```

[homebrew]: http://brew.sh/
