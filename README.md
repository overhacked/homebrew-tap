# Homebrew Formulae

This is the [Homebrew][] tap for my ([@Overhacked](https://github.com/overhacked)) projects, currently just [`ssh-agent-mux`](https://github.com/overhacked/ssh-agent-mux).

These formulae are available for both Mac and Linux homebrew and for `amd64/x86_64` and `arm64/aarch64` architectures.

## Initial setup

If you don't have Homebrew, install it from their [homepage][homebrew].

Then, add this tap:

```
brew tap overhacked/tap
```

## Installing

<!-- project_table_start -->
| Project | Description  | Install  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| [ssh-agent-mux](https://github.com/overhacked/ssh-agent-mux) | Combine keys from multiple SSH agents into one agent | `brew install ssh-agent-mux` |        
<!-- project_table_end -->

## Updating

Simply run:

```
brew update
brew upgrade PROJECT_NAME
```

[homebrew]: http://brew.sh/
